============

Simple MongoDB wrapper for Python.

Made with the following goals on mind:

- Simple and clean schema definition
- Map field's names to short names to save disk
- Extract data from mixed native python nested dict based on the schema
- Ensure by code, as the schema evolve, still accessing the schema's fields correctly
